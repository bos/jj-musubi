# Conformance between the Lean model and the Rust core

The Lean model in `formal/` proves the protocol's properties. The Rust core in
`crates/musubi-core` implements the protocol. This document defines the link between them: a
trace format, an oracle built from the Lean model, and a refinement check run under Hegel.

## The claim

Every behavior of the Rust core, at the level of abstraction of the model, is a behavior of
the Lean model. The Lean safety theorems hold for every reachable model state, so they hold
for every state the Rust core reaches. A run in which the hub goes back is a behavior of the
extended model of `formal/Musubi/Regress.lean`, and the weaker invariant proved there holds
in it.

The chain has three links:

1. **Relational model to executable model.** `formal/Musubi/Exec.lean` defines `execStep`
   on finite states. `exec_sound` proves that whenever `execStep` accepts an action other
   than `hubRegress`, the corresponding relational `Step` exists between the abstracted
   states, and `exec_rsound` that whenever it accepts any action, an `RStep` of the extended
   model does. The executable model therefore never accepts anything the proofs don't cover.
2. **Executable model to oracle.** `formal/Oracle.lean` is a thin JSON wrapper around
   `execStep`, built by `lake build oracle`. It contains no protocol logic of its own.
3. **Oracle to Rust.** The Hegel conformance tests in `crates/musubi-core/tests/conformance.rs`
   run the Rust hub and nodes, translate every step they take into model actions, and check
   each one with the oracle. They fail on any action the oracle rejects, or any difference
   between the Rust state and the oracle's state. Hegel shrinks failures to a minimal trace.

## The abstraction

The conformance tests run the real Rust core (`HubCore`, `NodeCore`, and their message
handling) against test implementations of its storage traits. These keep exactly the
model's state:

| Model | Rust test implementation |
| --- | --- |
| Universe: `next`, `par`, `objs` | the test's operation table; operation and object ids are small integers, root `0` |
| Hub `ops`, `objs`, `head`, `seq` | `FakeHubStorage` |
| Node `lops`, `lobj`, `heads`, `known`, `sops`, `sobj` | `FakeRepo` (`lops`…`sobj`) and `NodeCore` (`known`) |
| `net`, the set of every message sent | the test's network: a set, so any message can be delivered any number of times, or never |

The jj-specific parts of a real node (canonicalization, realization, bundles) are not
covered by this link. The jj integration tests and the generated end-to-end tests cover them.

## Wire format

The oracle reads one JSON object per line on stdin and writes one per line on stdout. Every
request gets exactly one reply.

### Requests

```json
{"op": "reset", "nodes": 3}
{"op": "step", "action": <action>}
```

### Actions

Fields mirror the constructors of `EnvStep` and `SyncStep` in `formal/Musubi/Model.lean`.
`node` is a node index below `nodes`. Op and object ids are naturals. Sets are arrays,
compared as sets.

| `"kind"` | Fields | Model step |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `userOp` | `node`, `parent`, `objs` | `EnvStep.userOp`: the new op gets id `next` |
| `merge` | `node`, `parents`, `objs` | `EnvStep.merge`: `parents` must enumerate `heads` |
| `getHead` | `node` | `SyncStep.getHead` |
| `learn` | `node`, `headKind`, `seq`, `head` | `SyncStep.learn`: the `head` message must be in `net`, and `seq > known.seq` |
| `fetchOps` | `node`, `ops` | `SyncStep.fetchOps` |
| `fetchObjs` | `node`, `objs` | `SyncStep.fetchObjs` |
| `recvOps` | `node`, `ops` | `SyncStep.recvOps` |
| `recvObjs` | `node`, `objs` | `SyncStep.recvObjs` |
| `realize` | `node`, `opId` | `SyncStep.realize` |
| `advance` | `node` | `SyncStep.advance` |
| `uploadOps` | `node`, `ops` | `SyncStep.uploadOps` |
| `uploadObjs` | `node`, `objs` | `SyncStep.uploadObjs` |
| `push` | `node`, `expected`, `new` | `SyncStep.push` |
| `pushAll` | `node`, `ops`, `objs`, `expected`, `new` | `SyncStep.pushAll`: the merged `Push` |
| `fetchAll` | `node`, `base`, `haves` | `SyncStep.fetchAll`: the merged `Fetch` |
| `crashNode` | `node` | `SyncStep.crashNode` |
| `loseKnown` | `node` | `SyncStep.loseKnown`: `known := (0, root)` |
| `loseVolatile` | `node` | `SyncStep.loseVolatile` |
| `hubGetHead` | `node` | `SyncStep.hubGetHead` |
| `hubPutOps` | `node`, `ops` | `SyncStep.hubPutOps` |
| `hubPutObjs` | `node`, `objs` | `SyncStep.hubPutObjs` |
| `hubGetOps` | `node`, `ops` | `SyncStep.hubGetOps` |
| `hubGetObjs` | `node`, `objs` | `SyncStep.hubGetObjs` |
| `casIdem` | `node`, `expected`, `new` | `SyncStep.casIdem` |
| `casAccept` | `node`, `expected`, `new` | `SyncStep.casAccept` |
| `casReject` | `node`, `expected`, `new` | `SyncStep.casReject` |
| `hubPushIdem` | `node`, `ops`, `objs`, `expected`, `new` | `SyncStep.hubPushIdem` |
| `hubPushAccept` | `node`, `ops`, `objs`, `expected`, `new` | `SyncStep.hubPushAccept` |
| `hubPushReject` | `node`, `ops`, `objs`, `expected`, `new` | `SyncStep.hubPushReject` |
| `hubPushIncomplete` | `node`, `ops`, `objs`, `expected`, `new` | `SyncStep.hubPushIncomplete` |
| `hubFetch` | `node`, `base`, `haves` | `SyncStep.hubFetch`: replies with a `head`, an `ops` and an `objs` message |
| `crashHub` | none | `SyncStep.crashHub` |
| `hubRegress` | `seq` | `RStep`'s `State.regress` (`Regress.lean`), the hub going back: `seq ≤ hub.seq`; `head := hist seq`, `seq := seq`, and nothing else changes |

`headKind` is one of `head`, `accepted`, `rejected`, `incomplete`, `notify`. The Rust hub
decides how to answer a `Push`, and the test sends whichever of `hubPushIdem`,
`hubPushAccept`, `hubPushReject`, or `hubPushIncomplete` it chose. The oracle checks that
choice's guard, so a hub that accepts a `Push` the model would reject is caught, and so is
one that rejects a `Push` the model says is incomplete. The Rust core sends only the merged
requests; the finer-grained actions remain in the model and the oracle.

### Replies

```json
{"ok": true, "state": <state>}
{"ok": false, "error": "casAccept: closure of 7 not stored at hub (missing op 6)"}
```

A rejected action leaves the oracle's state unchanged. The error names the guard that failed,
as `"<action>: <guard>"`, for example
`casAccept: closure of 1 not stored at hub (missing op 1)`.

Two consequences of the model that the Rust test implementations must match:

- `realize` adds an operation to `lops` and its objects to `lobj` but does not remove them
  from `sops` and `sobj`. Staging is only ever cleared by `loseVolatile`.
- `casAccept` adds an `accepted` reply for the sender and a `notify` message for every node
  below `nodes`, including the sender.

### State

```json
{
  "next": 5,
  "ops": [{"id": 1, "parents": [0], "objs": [10]}, ...],
  "hub": {"ops": [0, 1], "objs": [10], "head": 1, "seq": 1},
  "nodes": [
    {"lops": [0, 1], "lobj": [10], "heads": [1], "known": [1, 1], "sops": [], "sobj": []}
  ],
  "net": [
    {"msg": "getHead", "node": 0},
    {"msg": "putOps", "node": 0, "ops": [1]},
    {"msg": "putObjs", "node": 0, "objs": [10]},
    {"msg": "getOps", "node": 0, "ops": [1]},
    {"msg": "getObjs", "node": 0, "objs": [10]},
    {"msg": "cas", "node": 0, "expected": 0, "new": 1},
    {"msg": "head", "node": 0, "headKind": "accepted", "seq": 1, "head": 1},
    {"msg": "ops", "node": 0, "ops": [1]},
    {"msg": "objs", "node": 0, "objs": [10]},
    {"msg": "stored", "node": 0},
    {"msg": "push", "node": 0, "ops": [1], "objs": [10], "expected": 0, "new": 1},
    {"msg": "fetch", "node": 1, "base": 0, "haves": []}
  ]
}
```

Every array is sorted ascending. `net` is sorted by `(msg, node, ...)`. `ops` lists every
created operation except the root.

## Running it

```sh
cargo nextest run -p musubi-core     # protocol_invariants and conformance
```

The conformance test runs `lake build oracle` first, so that the oracle matches the model;
it does nothing when the oracle is up to date. The oracle binary is
`formal/.lake/build/bin/oracle`. Setting `MUSUBI_ORACLE` to another binary skips the build,
as CI does with the one it has just built.
`formal/test/run_smoke.sh` replays a fixed two-node run through it.

The test makes 150 cases on CI, where it runs as a job of its own, and 50 elsewhere, where
it would otherwise take most of `just test`'s time. `MUSUBI_CONFORMANCE_CASES` sets the
number; `just mutants` sets 150.

## Evidence that the check has teeth

Deliberately broken versions of the core, each caught:

| Change | Caught by |
| --- | --- |
| Hub accepts a `Push` without checking the closure is stored | invariants (HubClosed) and conformance |
| Hub accepts a `Push` without checking ancestry | invariants and conformance |
| Hub accepts a `Push` when `head ≠ expected` | invariants and conformance |
| Node realizes an operation before its parents | invariants and conformance |
| Node realizes an operation before its objects arrive | invariants and conformance |
| Node learns a head whose `seq` equals the one it knows | conformance only: harmless, but not a model step |

`just mutants` (cargo-mutants over `hub.rs` and `node.rs`) leaves no surviving mutant out
of 61. Earlier versions had survivors; tests that killed them added a lying hub, a hub that
forgets unaccepted uploads, a directed test for re-uploading after a forgotten upload, and a
node that crashes after staging operations but before staging their objects. Without that
crash no node ever lacked the objects of an operation it had staged, so nothing checked
that it asks for them.

## How Rust events map to model actions

| Rust core event | Model actions |
| --- | --- |
| A machine runs a `jj` command (test rule) | `userOp` |
| `NodeCore` asks the repo to merge heads | `merge` |
| `NodeCore` sends `Fetch { base, haves }`, on every poll | `fetchAll` |
| `NodeCore` sends `GetObjects { for_ops: S, haves: H, .. }` | `fetchObjs` with `objs(S) \ H` |
| `NodeCore` sends `Push { ops: S, objects: O, expected, new, .. }` | `pushAll` |
| `NodeCore` accepts a head-carrying reply | `learn`; a stale one it ignores maps to nothing |
| `NodeCore` takes in a `Fetched` reply | `learn` if its head is newer, then `recvOps` and `recvObjs` if it stages the operations; the states are compared after the last |
| `NodeCore` stages an `Objects` reply | `recvObjs` |
| `NodeCore` realizes or advances | `realize` / `advance` |
| The hub handles `Fetch` | `hubFetch` |
| The hub handles `GetObjects { for_ops: S, haves: H, .. }` | `hubGetObjs` with `objs(S) \ H` |
| The hub handles `Push` | `hubPushIdem`, `hubPushAccept`, `hubPushReject`, or `hubPushIncomplete` |
| A node restarts | `loseKnown` (its staged files survive; `known` does not) |
| A node restarts while taking in a `Fetched` reply, after staging its operations and before staging its objects (test rule) | `learn` if its head is newer, `recvOps`, then `loseKnown` |
| The hub restarts | `crashHub` |
| The hub goes back (test rule) | `hubRegress` |
| A reply to the node's own request that says the hub went back (`NodeCore::handle_reply`) | `loseKnown`, then `learn` if the reply's `seq` is above 0 (at 0, the restarted node already knows `(0, root)`) |

The test's objects have no structure, so the test's hub ignores `closure(base)` and leaves
out exactly what the haves name, as the model's `hubFetch` does; a node's haves there are
every object it holds.
